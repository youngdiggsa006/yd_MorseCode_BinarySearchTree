# yd_MorseCode_BinarySearchTree
This project comprises two classes: the MorseCharacter class, housing MorseCode objects characterized by a letter and its corresponding Morse code, and the MorseCodeTree class. The MorseCodeTree class is responsible for constructing a binary search tree of Morse code, leveraging the bridges BSTElement<K,E> with parameters (String label, String key, MorseCharacter obj). The utilization of the bridges library grants access to the necessary data structure for implementing the binary search tree. Additionally, the MorseCodeTree class incorporates methods for encoding and decoding the tree itself. It further provides various tree traversal methods for versatile tree exploration (inorder, preorder, & postorder).
